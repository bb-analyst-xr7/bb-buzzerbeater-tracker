# BB Insider

CLI tools for extracting match data and tracking buzzerbeaters.

## Setup (once)

1. Install `uv`: https://docs.astral.sh/uv/
2. Create a local `.env` in repo root:
   - `BB_USERNAME=...`
   - `BB_SECURITY_CODE=...`
3. No extra install needed! Just run commands with with `uv run <command> ...`
   - Full options for any command: `uv run <command> --help`

## Main Tracking Workflow (3 commands)

These are the primary tracking commands for buzzerbeaters:

1. `bbinsider-buzzerbeaters`: check one match for buzzerbeaters (read-only, no DB writes).
2. `bbinsider-team-buzzerbeaters`: scan many matches and write/update `data/buzzerbeaters.db`.
3. `bbinsider-buzzerbeater-descriptions`: read `data/buzzerbeaters.db` and render text/summary output.

### `bbinsider-buzzerbeaters`

Detect buzzerbeaters in one match.

Useful flags:

- `--matchid` (required)
- `--details` (show linked shot/free-throw details)
- `--json`

Example (use your own match ID that has a buzzerbeater):

```bash
uv run bbinsider-buzzerbeaters --matchid <MATCH_ID> --details
```

### `bbinsider-team-buzzerbeaters`

Scan team matches and build/update buzzerbeater records in the local DB.

Option guide:

- `--teamid` (required): team to track.
- Season selection (pick one approach):
  - `--season <S>`: one season only.
  - `--seasons <S1,S2,...>`: explicit list.
  - `--season-from <A> --season-to <B>`: inclusive range.
- `--auto-first-season`: auto-detect the first season for the team name.
  - With no season flags, scans detected-first-season through current season.
  - With `--season-to`, sets the start from detected first season.
- `--from-first-active`: for the first scanned season, start from the team's first active match instead of all completed matches. Useful for teams that debuted mid-season.
- `--db <PATH>`: target SQLite database path (default `data/buzzerbeaters.db`).

Main usage (multi-season tracking with auto-detected start):

```bash
uv run bbinsider-team-buzzerbeaters \
  --teamid 142720 \
  --from-first-active \
  --auto-first-season \
  --season-to 71
```

First output lines:

After this command runs, the DB will have a `buzzerbeaters` table with one row per detected buzzerbeater event, linked to matches/players/opponents. Next, use `bbinsider-buzzerbeater-descriptions` to query and render human-readable summaries (see next section).

Alternatively (explicit range):

```bash
uv run bbinsider-team-buzzerbeaters \
  --teamid 142720 \
  --season-from <SEASON_FROM> \
  --season-to <SEASON_TO>
```

### `bbinsider-buzzerbeater-descriptions`

Query the DB and render human-readable buzzerbeater lines and summaries.

Option guide:

- Data source:
  - `--db <PATH>` (default `data/buzzerbeaters.db`)
- Filters:
  - `--teamid`, `--opponent-id`, `--matchid`, `--player-id`
- Output mode:
  - `--verbosity 0`: tabular rows.
  - `--columns "col1,col2,..."`: columns used with `--verbosity 0`.
  - `--verbosity 1` or `--verbosity 2`: descriptive text output.
- Summary controls:
  - `--summary`: append aggregate breakdowns.
  - `--top-players <N>`: top players count in summary.
- Content filters:
  - `--only-outcome-change`: only events that changed game state at the buzzer.
- Link formatting:
  - `--no-url`: remove forum tags/viewer links from text.
- Special report modes (return immediately with dedicated tables):
  - `--multi-buzzer-games`
  - `--multi-player-games`

Example:

```bash
uv run bbinsider-buzzerbeater-descriptions --teamid 142720 --summary
```

with first lines of output:
